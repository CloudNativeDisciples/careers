# Implementation Services / DevOps Engineer

## About us

Gravitational, an early stage systems & cloud startup in San Francisco, is looking for ambitious and talented people. We are well-funded by fantastic Silicon Valley investors. We are an experienced team: we founded [Mailgun](http://mailgun.com) which was acquired by [Rackspace](http://rackspace.com), we created [Vulcand](https://github.com/vulcand/vulcand) and some other [cool stuff](http://www.rackspace.com/blog/onmetal-the-right-way-to-scale/) at Rackspace and are authors of [Teleport](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport) and [Telekube](https://gravitational.com/telekube)

We are hackers. We love Linux and low level systems programming and we love helping open source communities and other engineers to get things done.

We are also dedicated to our friends, families, and hobbies outside of work. Our past experiences building companies taught us about the importance of life and work balance. It matters even more when you are building a huge and lasting company, like Gravitational.

If this resonates, we want to talk to you.

## About you

You understand how computers work and what role an operating system plays. You know why the Linux kernel is written in C and not any other language. You have a favorite file system, you know what a syscall is and you are comfortable exploring `/proc` and `/sys`. You like the idea of using Go, Python, Terraform and Ansible every day, are not afraid of Makefiles and you enjoy setting up secrets management, CI/CD automation, networks and clusters deployment. You understand networking very well and know what `ip netns`, `StrongSwarm` and VXLAN mean and are excited to use them daily.

You should also be comfortable joining an early stage company with a dynamic future. We offer a great salary, but expect you to value the equity as well. In return we will be very transparent with you about the company finances and outlook. You are joining a founding team and we want you to enjoy the ride.

If you are this kind of person, here is what you will be working on:

* Closely interact with customers to build complex Kubernetes deployments of microservices.
* Build deployment automation tools with Go, Terraform, Kubernetes and containers.
* Tweak, setup and configure networking automation, write CNI plugins and contribute to open source automation tools.

## Location

We would prefer everyone to be in San Francisco or Germany and we can relocate you. We will consider remote option for experienced candidates with a history of getting things done.
