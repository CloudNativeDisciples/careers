# Sales Reps

## About us

Gravitational is a Y Combinator backed software startup in Oakland. We are well-funded and have a clear path to profitability. The founding team is experienced, including founding [Mailgun](http://mailgun.com), which was acquired by [Rackspace](http://rackspace.com), and creating significant [product offerings](http://www.rackspace.com/blog/onmetal-the-right-way-to-scale/) at Rackspace. We are a small team of 10, consisting mostly of software engineers.

We are also dedicated to our friends, families, and hobbies outside of work. Our past experiences building companies taught us about the importance of life and work balance. It matters even more when you are building a huge and lasting company, like Gravitational.

## About the opportunity

We build software that allows businesses to deploy and manage applications across clouds and on-premise infrastrcture environments. Our technology is built using the fastest growing open source projects available today: Kubernetes, Docker and other container-based technologies.

We are currently selling successfully to large technology companies, including telecoms, SaaS providers and enterprise software companies. The possible market size is much larger and growing - anyone that manages and operates server fleets and applications across cloud providers and/or internal data centers (i.e., almost all successful companies). There are multiple use cases for our offerings: migrating legacy workloads to the cloud, selling SaaS offerings on-premise, improving the efficiency of Ops and SRE teams, securing internal IT systems, and more.

We have developed a popular open sourced project on Github called [Teleport](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport) that generates a good amount of leads. We have been successful bootstrapping sales with the founding team (w/out any sales experience), generating millions in revenue within a couple years without any marketing spend. 

Now we need help taking the business to the next level. We plan on starting by hiring two sales reps and building the team from there, based on their success.

## About you and the role

* You have a technical background, with on-the-job ops / SRE / devops experience preferred. We are selling to Engineering and IT professionals, so you need to be on their level, technically.
* You have some experience in sales, sales engineering or account management with technical offerings.
* You are ready to get your hands dirty. We are _NOT_ looking for a VP of Sales to build and manage a team in the near term. We are looking for people that are ready to hustle, develop leads and learn to sell the offerings side by side with the founding team. Of course, becoming the VP of Sales is a natural career progression opportunity.
* There is a lot of work to be done so you don't mind pitching in on helping with marketing collateral, product marketing / sales strategy, traveling to conferences / events, hiring, etc.
* You are excited about the opportunity and therefore would prefer a commision heavy comp structure.

## Location

We are located in Oakland (Jack London Square).  Our office has great views of the marina, a gym, pool, free parking and is a close walk from the Lake Merrit Bart station.
