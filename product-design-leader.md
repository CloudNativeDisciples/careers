## About us

Gravitational, an early stage systems & cloud startup in San Francisco, is looking for ambitious and talented people. We are well-funded by fantastic Silicon Valley investors. We are an experienced team: we founded [Mailgun](http://mailgun.com) which was acquired by [Rackspace](http://rackspace.com), we created [Vulcand](https://github.com/vulcand/vulcand) and some other [cool stuff](http://www.rackspace.com/blog/onmetal-the-right-way-to-scale/) at Rackspace. 

We are hackers. We love Linux and low level systems programming and we love helping open source communities and other engineers to get things done.

We are also dedicated to our friends, families, and hobbies outside of work. Our past experiences building companies taught us about the importance of life and work balance. It matters even more when you are building a huge and lasting company, like Gravitational.

If this resonates, we want to talk to you.

## About you

You should be naturally curious and passionate about seeking new ways for humans and computers to interact with each other. We want you to take the lead, define the end user experience and own the roadmap for it.

Not only you should be a leader, you should also be a maker. Can you design something great and also dive into JavaScript and CSS when necessary? You will work with front-end engineers but you should be ready to get your hands dirty.

You should also be comfortable joining an early stage company with a dynamic future. You should be comfortable with a significant portion of your compensation in equity and in return we will be very transparent with you about the company finances and outlook. You are joining a founding team and we want you to enjoy the ride.

If you are this kind of person, here is the menu of what you can be doing with us:

* Design wireframes of the user-facing parts of our product.
* Own the website, our blog, our corporate style.
* Provide design direction to a small team of front-end and full-stack engineers.
* Help implement website, control panel and other front-end development when bottlenecks occur.
* Talk to customers and convert complex requirements into simple and elegant solutions.

## Location

We prefer for our product team to be in San Francisco and we can relocate you if you are already eligible to work in the U.S.
