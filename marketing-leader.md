## About us

Gravitational, an early stage systems & cloud startup in San Francisco, is looking for ambitious and talented people. We are well-funded by fantastic Silicon Valley investors. We are an experienced team: we founded [Mailgun](http://mailgun.com) which was acquired by [Rackspace](http://rackspace.com), we created [Vulcand](http://vulcand.io) and some other [cool stuff](http://www.rackspace.com/blog/onmetal-the-right-way-to-scale/) at Rackspace. 

We are hackers. We love Linux and low level systems programming and we love helping open source communities and other engineers to get things done.

We are also dedicated to our families, friends, and hobbies outside of work. Our past experiences building companies taught us about the importance of life and work balance. It matters even more when you are building a huge and lasting company, like Gravitational.

If this resonates, we want to talk to you.

## About you

You should have a broad knowledge of digital marketing channels and techniques and have the technical aptitude to execute on them. We want you to have the freedom to create strategies based on your previous knowledge and test and optimize them based on data-driven results. You will be working with the founders of the company to understand the product and market and then it's up to you to run the marketing efforts at the company.

Not only a leader, you should also be technical and a maker. Can you create thousands of landing pages from a template to test a theory, optimize complicated SEM/SEO strategies or summon an army of bots to get competitive intelligence? You will work with our other engineers but you should be ready to get your hands dirty. Someone with a passion for marketing and experience in programming is ideal.

You should also be comfortable joining an early stage company with a dynamic future. You should be comfortable with a significant portion of your compensation in equity and in return we will be very transparent with you about the company finances and outlook. You are joining a founding team and we want you to enjoy the ride.

If you are this kind of person, here is the menu of what you will be doing with us (TL/DR everything marketing related):

* Test various channels, measure and double down on the most effective ones.
* Help with branding, tone and company image.
* Develop content marketing topics and strategies and find creators to help implement them (internal and external).
* Reach out to customers and partners to create co-marketing programs.
* Help implement landing pages, A/B testing, and other technical / tactical tasks.
* Manage the tooling and data to implement and measure marketing programs.
* Find and engage with other resources you need (contractors, agencies, etc.) to do the things you don't have time for (we understand you're only one person:).
* Build the marketing team once you have a plan to scale.

## Location

We prefer for our product team to be in San Francisco and we can relocate you if you are already eligible to work in the U.S.
