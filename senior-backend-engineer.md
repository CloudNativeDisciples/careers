Gravitational, an early stage systems & cloud startup in San Francisco, is looking for ambitious and talented people. We are well-funded by fantastic Silicon Valley investors. We are an experienced team: we built Mailgun which was acquired Rackspace, we created Vulcand and we have great connections in the cloud industry.

We are hackers. We love Linux and low level systems programming and we love helping open source communities and other engineers to get things done.

We are also husbands, fathers and we have hobbies. Our past experiences building companies taught us about the importance of life and work balance. It matters even more when you are building a huge and lasting company, like Gravitational.

If this resonates, we want to talk to you.

About you

You understand how computers work and what role an operating system plays. You know why Linux kernel is written in C and not any other language. You have a favorite file system, you know what a syscall is and you are comfortable exploring /proc and /sys. You like using Go every day, are not afraid of Makefiles and you enjoy when thousands of servers bend to your will.

You should also be comfortable joining an early stage company with a dynamic future. We offer a great salary, but expect you to value the equity as well. In return we will be very transparent with you about the company finances and outlook. You are joining a founding team and we want you to enjoy the ride.

If you are this kind of person, here is what you will be working on:

Hack on technologies like systemd and libcontainer.
Design and build new open source products you can be proud of.
Talk to customers and convert complex requirements into simple and elegant solutions.
Daily code reviews.

Location

US residents only (bad timing for H1b). We would prefer everyone to be in San Francisco and we can relocate you. We will consider remote option for experienced candidates with a history of getting things done.
