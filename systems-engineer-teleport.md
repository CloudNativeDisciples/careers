# Senior Golang/Linux systems engineer, Teleport

## About us

Gravitational, an early stage systems & cloud startup in Oakland, CA, is looking for ambitious and talented people. 
We are well-funded by fantastic Silicon Valley investors. 
We are an experienced team: we founded [Mailgun](http://mailgun.com) which was acquired by [Rackspace](http://rackspace.com), 
we created [Vulcand](https://github.com/vulcand/vulcand) and some other 
[cool stuff](http://www.rackspace.com/blog/onmetal-the-right-way-to-scale/) at Rackspace and are authors of 
[Teleport](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport) and [Telekube](https://gravitational.com/telekube)

We are hackers. We love Linux and low level systems programming and we love helping open source communities and other 
engineers to get things done.

We are also dedicated to our friends, families, and hobbies outside of work. Our past experiences building companies 
taught us about the importance of life and work balance. It matters even more when you are building a huge and 
lasting company, like Gravitational.

If this resonates, we want to talk to you.

## About you

You understand how computers work and what role an operating system plays. 

You know why the Linux kernel is written in C and not any other language. You have a favorite file system, 
you know what a syscall is and you are comfortable exploring `/proc` and `/sys`. 

You like using Go every day, are not afraid of Makefiles and you enjoy when thousands of servers bend to your will.
You have solid understanding of key aspects of systems engineering - caching, distributed systems, know
fundamentals of cryptography engineering and understand aspects of building secure systems.

You should also be comfortable joining an early stage company with a dynamic future. 
We offer a great salary, but expect you to value the equity as well. 
In return we will be very transparent with you about the company finances and outlook. 
You are joining a founding team and we want you to enjoy the ride.
